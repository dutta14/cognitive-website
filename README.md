# Cognitive Measures Web Pilot Portal
Website for cognitive measures pilot test, available [here](http://projecttalent.usc.edu/pilot/).

The website can be used to pull out a list of users who have taken the cognitive measures test using the Android app [here](https://github.com/dutta14/Cognitive-Measures). For each user, we can then see the modules they answered, the time they used for each question, and the overall score of all the modules.
